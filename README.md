# Learning Rust with Advent of Code 2019

See the previous repos:

- [AOC 2019 in Clojure](https://github.com/nmyers217/advent_of_code_2019_clojure)
- [AOC 2018 in Nim](https://github.com/nmyers217/advent_of_code_2018_nim)

I have been avoiding Rust for far too long.
I tried it out a long time ago in late 2015 when it was still pretty new, and I felt pretty overwhelmed by it at the time.
But times have changed, and Rust is looking like a very usable systems level language these days, and a real viable competitor to C and C++.
In the places where the compiler used to feel like your arch enemy, it now seems like your best friend.
I have decided to take advantage of these slower days during the quarantine and learn some Rust using advent of code 2019!

The problems are on the [AOC website](https://adventofcode.com/2019/).

### Dependencies

- rustc and cargo (v1.43 at the time of writing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate into the project directory
3. cargo test for unit tests, or cargo run --release to solve the problems
